Title: Go Python

Looking at [OKFn coding standards](https://github.com/okfn/coding-standards), I discovered that Python is the prefered language so I decided to build the tool in Pyhton instead of Go.
Maybe in a second phase, I will (re)develop FrictionleesDarwinCore tool in Go.

The Python package will encapsulate all Darwin Core specificities : terms, format, metadata and data structure.
Ideally, DwC data files will not be touched. only metadata and structure will be adapted to fit the [Data Package specifications](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/).
